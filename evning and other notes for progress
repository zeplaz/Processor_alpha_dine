wow traslation, amazing, think acdmeic liqueist are great heros we need ahah. i love playing with lauages on the borders of eachther but im horrable with formal learning of the codes due to disgrpahiaédelxia.
my french is horrable, i did do like a year of "quebec french school;"
 but padmic occured in 2nd year. an epp. but soo im 35.
 i studied like econ and conentinal philsopy orginakl out in halifax but,
 basssssily cost of living tution and rest i never finshed the degree. in 2016 i went
 back, and tryed to study admistrative arts, but they reqierd alot of nosnese, so i took up
 comp sci back to econ, and any weird biz class cuz they boosted my grades. haha. endedip with
 some Baturateè of info tec. and miner in econ.  lost my with distciton cuz of an econ math class
  at 8am i resfued to drop knowing the prof hated me, and knwoing id basicly fail cuz i realllly
  watned to learn some of it haha. but ya. then did year or so, of self study in software enegerring to boost up the
 maths and comp sci stuff.  idk. also studied under alot of ademic musians, in and
  out of time and for the past like 2 and abit years i got this. software enegering
  job from my studied and a friend helping me into the ocmpany take up all my god damed time.
   but cost of living in caanda goten bleak and i do want to move out of here. soo figured few
    years at a office job is not the worst thing haha. got away with like 20 years of running
    non profits and studing and touring. sooo. whaver. but cernrtly aim to get to the moutnats as
     soon as possbale (Dinaric Alps
